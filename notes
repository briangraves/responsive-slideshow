What can I do to get you into a responsive website today?

1. From Scratch. The most efficient and preferred way to build a responsive website is from the ground up.  This option takes advantage of using a proper project workflow and making sure the user gets the best experience.

2. Retrofit.  Provides a better user experience for smaller devices on an existing website.  A decent option if the existing project (did this with purina)

3. Start with an "m dot".  Leave the existing desktop website.  Create an m.* mobile site, yet, make it responsive and eventually fade it into desktop.  People magazine took this approach.
